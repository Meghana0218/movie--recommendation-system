# Movie Recommendation System 🎥

A **web-based movie recommendation system** that utilizes **collaborative filtering** and **singular value decomposition (SVD)** to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

## 📊 Recommendation Algorithm

The system uses **collaborative filtering** to analyze user-movie interactions. Key steps:
1. **Pivot Matrix Creation**: User ratings are transformed into a matrix format.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) reduces noise and improves prediction accuracy.
3. **Cosine Similarity**: Identifies similar users based on their rating patterns.
4. **Personalized Suggestions**: Movies are ranked based on ratings from similar users.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Add **content-based filtering** to improve recommendations.
- Support for **multi-language movies** and **global audiences**.
- Integration with **external APIs** (e.g., TMDb) for detailed movie information.
- Deploy the system on platforms like **Heroku** or **AWS**.
